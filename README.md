## Requirements



## Installation

REPLACEMEMETHOD is the recommended installation method.

### Homebrew

```shell
brew install olets/tap/REPLACEMEREPO
```

### With a shell plugin manager

1. Install REPLACEMEREPO with a zsh plugin manager. Each has their own way of doing things. See your package manager's documentation or the [zsh plugin manager plugin installation procedures gist](https://gist.github.com/olets/06009589d7887617e061481e22cf5a4a). If you're new to zsh plugin management, at this writing zinit is a good choice for its popularity, frequent updates, and great performance.

    After adding the plugin to the manager, restart zsh:

    ```shell
    exec zsh
    ```

### Manual

1. Download [the latest `REPLACEMEREPO` binary](https://github.com/olets/REPLACEMEREPO/releases/latest)
